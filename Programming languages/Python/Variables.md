## Introduzione
In Python, a variable is an entity that is used to store a value or an instance of an object in memory. It is a name that refers to a reserved area of memory where a value is stored.

> [!Warning]
> In Python, it is **not necessary to declare the type of a variable** before using it, as the type is determined automatically during program execution. In other words, the type of the variable depends on the value that is assigned to it.

To define a variable in Python, you can use the following syntax:

```python
variable_name = value
```

Where `variable_name` is the name of the variable and `value` is the value that is assigned to the variable. 
## Naming Conventions
When naming variables in Python, there are some conventions that should be followed:

- The name of the variable should be descriptive and should represent what it is used for.
- The name of the variable should start with a lowercase letter.
- If the name of the variable contains multiple words, they should be separated by an underscore. For example, `my_variable`.
- Python has some reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names, such as `if`, `else`, `while`, and `for`.
