## Can we extrapole expectations? Amdahl’s law
Intuition: each program has some part of it which cannot be parallelized (serial fraction $1-a$)

Amdahl’s law says that the speedup is limited by the serial fraction ($s$)

(la parte con p può essere parallelizzata la parte con s no, (es. in loop per calcolare elemento corrente devo calcolare quello precedente)) per questo non si può mai ottenere lo speedup ideale

Amdahl’s law says that the speedup is limited by the serial fraction
$$
T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=(1-\alpha)T_{\text{serial}}+\frac{\alpha T_{\text{seiral}}}{p}
$$

A fraction $0\leq \alpha\leq 1$ can be parallelized. The remaining $1-a$ has to be done sequentially
alpha è la percentuale parallelizzabile

>[!example]
>- if $\alpha\neq 0$, the code can’t be parallelized and $T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=T_{\text{serial}}$
>- if $\alpha=1$, the entire code can be parallelized and $T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{p}$ (ideal speedup)

speedup
$$
S(p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{(1-\alpha)T_{\text{serial}}+\frac{\alpha T_{\text{serial}}}{p}}
$$

$$
\lim_{ p \to \infty } S(p)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}
$$

importante perchè dice limite asintotico a cui possiamo tendere con lo speedup

(to fix)
>[!example]
>- if $60\%$ of the application can be parallelized, $\alpha = 0.6$, which means we can expect a speedup of at most $2.5$
>- if $80\%$ of the application can be parallelized, $\alpha = 0.8$, which means we can expect a speedup of at most $5$
>
>To be able to scale up to $100000$ (è lo speedup) processes, we need to have $\alpha >= 0.99999$

## Gustafon’s law
(al posto di considerare lo strong scaling si usa il weak scaling)

If we consider weak scaling, the parallel fraction increases with the problem size (i.e., the serial time remains constant, but the parallel time increases)

It is also known as scaled speedup
$$
S(n,p)=(1-\alpha)+\alpha p
$$

## Amdahl’s law limitations
The serial fraction could get bigger when increasing the number of processor (i.e. the runtime might increase when increasing the number of processors)
