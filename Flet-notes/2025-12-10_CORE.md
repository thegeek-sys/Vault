## Shared memory
On-chip memory

shared memory è condivisa dai core in esecuzione su quell’sm

Can be used as:
- a place to hold frequently used data that would otherwise require a global memory access
- as a way for cores on the same SM to share data

The `__shared__` specifier can be used to indicate that some data must go in the shared on-chip memory rather than on the global memory

>[!info] Shared memory vs. L1 cache
>- both are on-chip. The former is managed by the programmer the latter automatically
>- in some cases, managing it manually (i.e., using the shared memory), might provide better performance (e.g., you do not have any guarantee that the data you need will be in the L1 cache, but with the explicitely managed shared memory, you can control that)

>Each thread processes one output element (`blockDim.x` elements per block), so input elements are read several times. For this reason with radius 3, each input element is read seven times
