## Elapsed parallel time

```c
double MPI_Wtime(void);
```

Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since some time in the past

>[!example]

>double start, finish;
>// ...
>start = MPI_Wtime():
>// code to be timed
>// ...
>finish = MPI_Wtime();
>printf("Proc %d > Elapsed time = %e seconds\n", my_rank, finish-start);
>```

>[!question] Which rank?

>>[!question] But `MPI_Barrier` is itself a collective, what if it is implemented with a tree? Every rank could exit the barrier at a different time
>>Guaranteeing that they start exactly at the same time is a bit more complicated. For the purposes of this course, `MPI_Barrier` provides a reasonable approximation

>[!question] Is one run/measurement enough?

>>If you run your application 100 times, you will get 100 different runtimes (this is also known as *noise*)

## Example: run-times of serial and parallel matrix-vector multiplication


![[Pasted image 20251026005908.png|470]]

- the runtime increases with the problem size
- the runtime decreases with the number of processes

>[!question] What expectations do we have?

>
>Let’s define with $T_{\text{serial}}(n)$ the time of our sequential application on a problem of size $n$ (e.g. $n$ is the dimension of the matrix)

>Let’s define with $S(n,p)$ the **speedup** of our parallel application

>$$S(n,p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}(n)}{T_{\text{parallel}}(n,p)}$$

>Thus, ideally, we would like to have $S(n,p)=p$. In this case, we say our program has a *linear speedup*

### Speedups of parallel matrix-vector multiplication
$$S(n,p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}(n)}{T_{\text{parallel}}(n,p)}$$

![[Pasted image 20251026010641.png|410]]
### Efficiencies of parallel matrix-vector multiplication
Here’s the definition of **efficiency**:
$$
E(n,p)=\frac{S(n,p)}{p}=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}(n)}{p\cdot T_{\text{parallel}}(n,p)}
$$

Ideally, we would like to have $E(n,p)=1$, but in practice it is $\leq 1$, and it gets worse with smaller problem sizes

## Strong vs. weak scaling
**Strong scaling**
Fix the problem size, and increase the number of processes. If we can keep a high efficiency, our program is *strong scalable*.

**Weak scaling**
Increase the problem size at the same rate at which you increase the number of processes (e.g. every time you  increase the number of processes by 2x, increase also the problem size by 2x). If we can keep a high efficiency, our program is *weak scalable*.

## Amdahl’s law

>[!info] Intuition
>Each program has some part of it which cannot be parallelized (serial fraction, $1-\alpha$) like reading/writing a file from disk, sending/receiving data over the network, serialization due to lock/unlock, etc.

![[Pasted image 20251028171035.png|400]]
In this image $p$ is the part that can be parallelized while $s$ is the part that cannot be

Amdahl’s law says that the speedup is limited by the **serial fraction** ($s$) 

$$
T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=(1-\alpha)T_{\text{serial}}+\frac{\alpha T_{\text{seiral}}}{p}
$$

A fraction $0\leq \alpha\leq 1$ can be parallelized while the remaining $1-a$ has to be done sequentially

>[!example]
>- if $\alpha= 0$, the code can’t be parallelized and $T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=T_{\text{serial}}$
>- if $\alpha=1$, the entire code can be parallelized and $T_{\text{parallel}}(p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{p}$ (ideal speedup)

Now let’s use $T_{\text{parallel}}(p)$ to express the speedup formula:
$$
S(p)=\frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{(1-\alpha)T_{\text{serial}}+\frac{\alpha T_{\text{serial}}}{p}}
$$

The following is the upper asymptotic limit of the speedup to which we can aim:
$$
\lim_{ p \to \infty } S(p)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}
$$

>[!example]
>- if $60\%$ of the application can be parallelized, $\alpha = 0.6$, which means we can expect a speedup of at most $2.5$
>- if $80\%$ of the application can be parallelized, $\alpha = 0.8$, which means we can expect a speedup of at most $5$
>
>To be able to scale up to $100000$ processes, we need to have $\alpha \geq 0.99999$

## Gustafson’s law
If we consider weak scaling (instead of the strong scaling considered in the Amdahl’s law), the parallel fraction increases with the problem size (i.e., the serial time remains constant, but the parallel time increases).

It is also known as **scaled speedup**.
$$
S(n,p)=(1-\alpha)+\alpha p
$$

### Amdahl’s law vs. Gustafson’s law
![[Pasted image 20251028172451.png]]

### Amdahl’s law limitations
The serial fraction could get bigger when increasing the number of processor (i.e. the runtime might increase when increasing the number of processors)

## Example 1: sum between vectors
$$
\begin{align}
x+y&=(x_{0},x_{1},\dots,x_{n-1})+(y_{0},y_{1},\dots,y_{n-1}) \\
&=(x_{0}+y_{0},x_{1}+y_{1},\dots,x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}) \\
&=(z_{0},z_{1},\dots,z_{n-1}) \\
&=\pmb{z}
\end{align}
$$
### Serial implementation

```c
void Vector_sum(double x[], double y[], double z[], int n) {
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
		z[i] = x[i] + y[i];
	}
}
```

### Parallel implementation
#### Vector addition

```c
void Parallel_vector_sum(
		double local_x[], // in
		double local_y[], // in
		double local_z[], // out
		int    local_n    // in
) {
	int local_i;
	for (local_i=0; local_i<local_n; local_i++)
		local_z[local_i] = local_x[local_i] + local_y[local_i];
}
```

But before `Parallel_vector_sum` we need to divide the vector into pieces and send it to the single processes. We can do this through [[Collective operations#$ verb MPI_Scatter $|MPI_Scatter]]

#### Reading and distributing a vector

```c
void Read_vector(
		double   local_a[],  // out
		int      local_n,    // in
		int      n,          // in
		char     vec_name[], // in
		int      my_rank,    // in
		MPI_Comm comm        // in
) {
	double* a = NULL;
	int i;
	
	if (my_rank == 0) {
		a = malloc(n*sizeof(double));
		printf("Enter the vector %s\n", vec_name);
		for (i=0; i<n; i++)
			scanf("%lf", &a[i]);
		MPI_Scatter(a, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, local_a, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
		free(a);
	} else {
		MPI_Scatter(a, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, local_a, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
	}
}
```

But now we need to create an output vector that contains all the single parts; we can do it through [[Collective operations#$ verb MPI_Gather $|MPI_Gather]]

#### Print a distributed vector

```c
void Print_vector(
	double   local_b[], // in
	int      local_n,   // in
	int      n,         // in
	char     title[],   // in
	int      my_rank,   // in
	MPI_Comm comm       // in
) {
	double* b = NULL;
	int i;
	
	if (my_rank == 0){
		b = malloc(n*sizeof(double));
		MPI_Gather(local_b, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, b, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
		printf("%s\n", title);
		for (i=0; i<n; i++)
			printf("%f ", b[i]);
		printf("\n");
		free(b);
	} else {
		MPI_Gather(local_b, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, b, local_n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
	}
}
```

## Example 2: matrix-vector multiplication

![[Pasted image 20251030171223.png|center]]

### Serial implementation

```c
void Mat_vect_mult(
	double A[], // in
	double x[], // in
	double y[], // out
	int    m,   // in
	int    n,   // in
) {
	int i,j;
	for(i=0; i<m; i++) {
		y[i] = 0.0;
		for (j=0; j<n; j++)
			y[i] += A[i*n+j]*x[j]
	}
}
```

### Parallel implementation
1. broadcast the vector $x$ from rank 0 to the other processes
2. scatter the rows of the matrix $A$ from rank 0 to the other processes
3. each process computer a subset of the elements of the resulting vector $y$
4. gather the final vector $y$ to rank 0

The $A$ matrix is scattered by rows, so each process contains `local_m` rows
```c
void Read_matrix(
	char     prompt[],  // in
	double   local_A[], //out
	int      m,         // in
	int      local_m,   // in
	int      n,         // in
	int      my_rank,   // in
	MPI_Comm comm       // in
) {
	double* A = NULL;
	int local_ok = 1;
	int i, j;
	
	if (my_rank == 0) {
		A = malloc(m*n*sizeof(double));
		printf("Enter the matrix %s\n", prompt)
		for (j=0; j<n; j++)
			scanf("%lf", &A[i*n+j]);
		MPI_Scatter(A, local_m*n, MPI_DOUBLE, local_A, local_m*n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
		free(A);
	} else {
		MPI_Scatter(A, local_m*n, MPI_DOUBLE, local_A, local_m*n, MPI_DOUBLE, 0, comm);
	}
}
```

Now, let’s assume that this is done in a loop, and the output y is used as the input vector for the next iteration

>[!example]
>- iteration $0$ → $A\cdot x$
>- iteration $1$ → $A\cdot y_{0}$
>- iteration $2$ → $A\cdot y_{1}$
>- …

**First iteration:**
1. broadcast the vector $x$ from rank 0
2. scatter the rows of the matrix $A$ from rank 0 to the other processes
3. each process computes a subset of the elements of the resulting vector $y_{0}$
4. gather the final vector $y_{0}$ to rank 0
5. broadcast $y_{0}$ from rank 0 to the other processes

**All the other iterations:**
1. each process computes a subset of the elements of the resulting vector $y_{i}$ using $y_{i-1}$ received in previous step
2. gather the final vector $y_{i}$ to rank 0
3. broadcast $y_{i}$ from rank 0 to the other processes
