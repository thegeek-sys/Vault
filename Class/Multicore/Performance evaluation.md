## Elapsed parallel time

```c
double MPI_Wtime(void);
```

Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since some time in the past

>[!example]
>```c
>double start, finish;
>// ...
>start = MPI_Wtime():
>// code to be timed
>// ...
>finish = MPI_Wtime();
>printf("Proc %d > Elapsed time = %e seconds\n", my_rank, finish-start);
>```

>[!question] Which rank?
>Each rank might finish at a different time
>>[!done] Solution
>>Report the maximum time across the ranks

>[!question] Is every rank going to start at the same time?
>Not necessarily. If not, the time we report might be longer not because the application was performing poorly, but rather because someone started later than someone else

>To ensure that they are going to start at the same time we use **`MPI_Barrier`**

>>[!question] But `MPI_Barrier` is itself a collective, what if it is implemented with a tree? Every rank could exit the barrier at a different time
>>Guaranteeing that they start exactly at the same time is a bit more complicated. For the purposes of this course, `MPI_Barrier` provides a reasonable approximation

>[!question] Is one run/measurement enough?
>No, performance data is not deterministic

>>[!example]
>>If you run your application 100 times, you will get 100 different runtimes (this is also known as *noise*)
>
>>[!question] Why?
>>- on a given compute node, interference from other applications and/or operating system (context switched, cache pollution, etc.) 
>>- across multiple nodes, interference on the network (is a resource shared among multiple nodes and applications)
