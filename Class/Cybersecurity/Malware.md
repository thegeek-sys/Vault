## Introduction

>[!quote] NIST 800-83 defines malware as
>”a program that is inserted into a system usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim”

## Classification of malware
The malwares can be classified into two broad categories:
- based first on how it spreads or propagates to reach the desired target
- then on the actions or the payload it performs once a target is reached

But can also be classified by:
- those that need a program (parasitic code such as viruses)
- those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans and bots)
- malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam email)
- malware that does replicate (viruses and worms)

### Types of malicious software
Propagation mechanisms include:
- infection of existing content by viruses that is subsequently spread to other systems
- exploit of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
- social engineering attacks that convince users to bypass security systems mechanisms to install trojans or to respond to phishing attacks

Payload actions performed by malware once it reaches a target system can include:
- corruption of system or data files
- theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
- theft of information from the system/keylogging
- hiding its presence on the system

## Attack kits
Initially the development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skill by software authors. But the development of virus-creation toolkits in the early 1990s and then more general attack kits in the 2000s made easier for everyone to create malware.

Toolkits are often known as *crimeware* and include a variety of propagation mechanisms and payload modules that even novices can deploy, but the problem for the defending systems comes when also variants can be generates by attacker using those same toolkits
