## Symmetric encryption
The universal technique for providing confidentiality for transmitted or stored data is **symmetric encryption**, also called conventional encryption or single-key encryption

It has two requirements for secure use:
- needs a strong encryption algorithm
- sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure
